# Neural Networks

As the assessment coursework for my Neural Networks final year project, I implemented a primative neural network to attempt to predict the GBP to USD exchange rates, using CORTEX Pro. The neural network was a back-propagated Multi-Layer Perceptron, trained with a three-month moving average for inflation, interest rates and past exchange rates.
